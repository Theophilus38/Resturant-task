    <h1>Serving Since 1983</h1>
    <p class="about-note">
        <em>Theophilus Foods began as a simple dream fueled by a passion for food and community. Founded in [insert
            year], the restaurant started with a small team and a big vision: to create a place where people could enjoy
            authentic, flavorful meals in a warm, welcoming atmosphere.

            The inspiration behind the name “Theophilus,” which means “friend of God,” comes from our founders’ belief
            that food is a universal way to connect, nourish, and bring joy to others. They envisioned a space where
            each dish would reflect the care, love, and dedication that go into creating great food—where people could
            come together, not just to eat, but to share in the experience of community and tradition.

            What began as a modest eatery soon grew into a beloved dining destination, thanks to our commitment to
            fresh, locally sourced ingredients and bold, flavorful cooking. Over the years, Theophilus Foods has
            evolved, incorporating new recipes and techniques while staying true to our roots. Our menu has expanded to
            offer a diverse range of dishes that celebrate both local and international flavors, appealing to a wide
            variety of palates.

            Through the ups and downs of the restaurant business, we’ve stayed focused on what truly matters: serving
            high-quality, soul-satisfying meals and treating every guest like family. Today, Theophilus Foods stands as
            a testament to the power of hard work, passion, and a love for sharing good food with good people.

            As we continue to grow, our mission remains the same: to provide a memorable dining experience where the
            love for food and community is always at the heart of everything we do.</em>
